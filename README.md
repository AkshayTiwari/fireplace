## Installation

```bash
npm install -d
```

Our dependencies:

- `nunjucks`: For templates
- `stylus`: For stylesheets

If you plan on doing compilation (i.e.: you're Wil Clouser), you'll also need

- `clean-css`: For minifying CSS or whatever
- `requirejs`: For warming up Spaceheater
- `uglify-js`: For minifying JS and L10n string extraction

### Flue

Comprehensive Flue documentation can be found in
[Flue's README](https://github.com/mozilla/fireplace/blob/master/flue/README.rst).


### Getting node/npm

#### OS X

```bash
brew install node
```

And make sure that `/usr/local/share/npm/bin` is in your `$PATH`, Ã  la: ::

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH
```


## Usage

From the terminal, run the following command

```bash
node damper.js
```

This will start a local server on 0.0.0.0:8675 by default.

To control the hostname and port you can use the following otions

```bash
node damper.js --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8888
```

In addition to an HTTP server, the damper will also run a Stylus watcher (to
recompile CSS as it's edited) and a template watcher (to recompile templates
as they're edited).

For instructions on running Flue (the mock API server), please see the [Flue
docs](https://github.com/mozilla/fireplace/blob/master/flue/README.rst).


### Compiling

To run the compilation process, which compiles templates, CSS, and locale
files, run the damper with the `--compile` argument:

```bash
node damper.js --compile
```

The damper will not start a local server in this case, but a `strings.po` file
will be generated.


### Compiling Includes

If you need to compile include files (i.e.: for Space Heater or a less HTTP-
heavy version of the project), run `make includes`. This will generate two files:

```
hearth/media/include.js
hearth/media/css/include.css
```

The CSS in `include.css` is generated in the order in which CSS files are
included in `hearth/index.html`.

`include.js` uses a lightweight AMD loader (rather than require.js). This keeps
file size down and also makes it possible to name-mangle internal keywords which
otherwise wouldn't be minifiable. Note that the only safe globals are `require`
and `define`---using any other non-browser globals will result in errors. I.e.:
accessing `_` without requiring `'underscore'` will cause the code to fail. Also
note that all modules must include a name as the first parameter.

Note that you need the dev dependencies to run this compilation. You can get
them by running `npm install -d`.


## Localizing

A detailed guide to extracting strings and creating JS language packs can be
found [on the wiki](https://github.com/mozilla/fireplace/wiki/L10n#extracting-strings).


## The API

[Read the docs.](http://firefox-marketplace-api.readthedocs.org/)


## Bugs

- If new templates or ``.styl`` files are added, they will not be recognized
  until the damper is restarted. Deleted files may also cause problems.


## Tests

Install casper

```bash
brew install casperjs
```


### Running unit tests:

Load [http://localhost:8675/tests](http://localhost:8675/tests) in your browser.


### Running functional tests:

Before you run the functional tests, make sure your `settings_local.js` file has
the subset of keys found in
[`settings_travis.js`](https://github.com/mozilla/fireplace/blob/master/hearth/media/js/settings_travis.js).

```bash
make test
```

## Missing Features

- `numberfmt` doesn't work (should probably be integrated with L10n
  pluralization)


## Local Development With Nginx

If you want to run a local Fireplace against your local
[Zamboni API](http://firefox-marketplace-api.readthedocs.org/)
you can use [nginx](http://nginx.org/).

The following snippet can go in the server section of your local
``nginx.conf``. It assumes the following parameters so change them
accordingly.

* You are running Zamboni at ``localhost:8000``
* You have Zamboni source checked out to ``/Users/your_name/dev``
* You want to access Fireplace at ``http://localhost/``


Snippet:

    http {
        ...
        server {
            listen       80 default;
            server_name  localhost;

            location / {
                rewrite ^/$ /server.html break;
                rewrite ^/abuse$ /server.html break;
                rewrite "^/app/(?![0-9a-f]{8}(-[0-9a-f]{4}){3}-[0-9a-f]{12}/manifest\.webapp$).*" /server.html break;
                rewrite ^/category/.* /server.html break;
                rewrite ^/debug$ /server.html break;
                rewrite ^/feedback$ /server.html break;
                rewrite ^/privacy-policy$ /server.html break;
                rewrite ^/purchases$ /server.html break;
                rewrite ^/search$ /server.html break;
                rewrite ^/settings$ /server.html break;
                rewrite ^/terms-of-use$ /server.html break;
                rewrite ^/tests$ /server.html break;
                rewrite ^/user/.* /server.html break;
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
            }

            location /media {
                alias /Users/your_name/dev/zamboni/media;
            }
        }
    }
